186 - Again We Meet around the Board

Again we meet around the board
Of Jesus, our redeeming Lord,
With faith in his atoning blood,
Our only access unto God.
He left his Father's courts on high,
With man to live, for man to die,
A world to purchase and to save
And seal a triumph o'er the grave.
Help us, O God, to realize
The great atoning sacrifice,
The gift of thy beloved Son,
The Prince of Life, the Holy One.
Oh, bless us, Lord, for Jesus' sake,
That we may worthily partake
These emblems of the flesh and blood
Of our Redeemer, Savior, God.
