320 - The Priesthood of Our Lord

Brethren, pow'r by earthly standards
Comes by rank or wealth or sword;
But the pow'r above all others
Is the priesthood of our Lord.
It is ours, the total armor
Priesthood held by Christ, our Lord
If, as brethren, we are worthy
Of the Spirit's whispered word.
Let us venture forth in freedom
With the priesthood as our guide
Deacons, teachers, priests, and elders,
Seeking virtue side by side.
