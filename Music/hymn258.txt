258. O Thou Rock Of Our Salvation

1. O thou Rock of our salvation,
Jesus, Savior of the world,
In our poor and lowly station
We thy banner have unfurled.
Gather round the standard bearer;
Gather round in strength of youth.
Ev’ry day the prospect’s fairer
While we’re battling for the truth.
2. We a war ’gainst sin are waging;
We’re contending for the right.
Ev’ry day the battle’s raging;
Help us, Lord, to win the fight.
Gather round the standard bearer;
Gather round in strength of youth.
Ev’ry day the prospect’s fairer
While we’re battling for the truth.
3. Onward, onward, we’ll be singing
As we’re marching firm and true,
Each succeeding battle ringing,
Earnest of what we can do.
Gather round the standard bearer;
Gather round in strength of youth.
Ev’ry day the prospect’s fairer
While we’re battling for the truth.
4. When for all that we’ve contended,
When the fight of faith we’ve won,
When the strife and battle’s ended,
And our labor here is done,
Then, O Rock of our salvation,
Jesus, Savior of the world,
Take us from our lowly station;
Let our flag with thee be furled.
