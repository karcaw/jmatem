267. How Wondrous and Great

How wondrous and great
Thy works, God of praise!
How just, King of Saints,
And true are thy ways!
Oh, who shall not fear thee
And honor thy name?
Thou only art holy,
Thou only supreme.
To nations long dark
Thy light shall be shown.
Their worship and vows
Shall come to thy throne.
Thy truth and thy judgments
Shall spread all abroad,
Till earth's ev'ry people
Confess thee their God.
