201 - Joy to the World

Joy to the world, the lord is come;
Let earth receive her King!
Let ev'ry heart prepare him room,

And Saints and angels sing,
And Saints and angels sing,
And Saints, and Saints 
and angels sing.
Rejoice! Rejoice when Jesus reigns,
And Saints their songs employ,
While fields and floods,
rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the 
sounding joy.
No more will sin and sorrow grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He'll come and make the blessings flow

Far as the curse was found,
Far as the curse was found,
Far as, far as the 
curse was found.
Rejoice! Rejoice in the Most High,
While Israel spreads abroad
Like stars that glitter in the sky,

And ever worship God,
And ever worship God,
And ever, and ever 
worship God.
