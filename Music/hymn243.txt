1.Let us all press on in the work of the Lord,
That when life is o'er we may gain a reward; 
In the fight for right let us wield a sword,
The mighty sword of truth.
Fear not, though the enemy deride;
Courage, for the Lord is on our side.
We will heed not what the wicked may say,
But the Lord alone we will obey.
2. We will not retreat,
though our numbers may be few
When compared with the 
opposite host in view;
But an unseen pow'r will aid me and you
In the glorious cause of truth.
Fear not, though the enemy deride;
Courage, for the Lord is on our side.
We will heed not what the wicked may say,
But the Lord alone we will obey.
3. If we do what's right 
we have no need to fear,
For the Lord, our helper, 
will ever be near;
In the days of trial his Saints he will cheer,
And prosper the cause of truth.
Fear not, though the enemy deride;
Courage, for the Lord is on our side.
We will heed not what the wicked may say,
But the Lord alone we will obey.
