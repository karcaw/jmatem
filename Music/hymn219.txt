Because I have been given much,
I too must give.
Because of thy great bounty, 
Lord each day I live.
I shall divide my gifts from thee 
with every brother that I see,
who has the need of help from me.
Because I have been sheltered, 
fed by thy good care…
I cannot see another’s lack and I not share-
my glowing fire, my loaf of bread-
my roof’s safe shelter over head,
that he too may be comforted.
Because I have been blessed
by thy great love dear Lord,
I’ll share thy love again 
according to thy word.
I shall give love to those in need. 
I’ll show that love by word and deed,
thus shall my thanks be thanks indeed.
