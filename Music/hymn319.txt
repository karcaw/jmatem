319 - Ye Elders of Israel

Ye elders of Israel, 
come join now with me
And seek out the righteous,
where'er they may be,
In desert, on mountain,
on land, or on sea
And bring them to Zion,
the pure and the free.
O Babylon, O Babylon, 
we bid thee farewell;
We're going to the mountains 
of Ephraim to dwell.
The harvest is great, 
and the lab'rers are few;
But if we're united, 
we all things can do.
We'll gather the wheat from 
the midst of the tares
And bring them from bondage, 
from sorrows and snares.
O Babylon, O Babylon, 
we bid thee farewell;
We're going to the mountains 
of Ephraim to dwell.
We'll go to the poor, 
like our Captain of old,
And visit the weary, 
the hungry, and cold;
We'll cheer up their hearts 
with the news that he bore
And point them to Zion 
and life evermore.
O Babylon, O Babylon, 
we bid thee farewell;
We're going to the mountains 
of Ephraim to dwell.
