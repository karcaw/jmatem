265 - Arise, O God, and Shine

Arise, O God, and shine
In all thy saving might,
And prosper each design
To spread thy glorious light;
Let healing streams of mercy flow,
That all the earth thy truth may know.
Bring distant nations near
To sing thy glorious praise;
Let ev'ry people hear
And learn thy holy ways.
Reign, mighty God, assert thy cause,
And govern by thy righteous laws.
Put forth thy glorious pow'r,
That Gentiles all may see,
And earth present her store
In converts born to thee.
O Lord, our God, thy Church so bless,
And fill the world with righteousness.
To God, the only wise,
The one immortal King,
Let hallelujahs rise
From ev'ry living thing;
Let all that breathe, on ev'ry coast,
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
