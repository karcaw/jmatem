1. Be thou humble in thy weakness,
and the Lord thy God shall teach thee
Shall lead thee by the hand and 
give thee answer to thy prayers.
Be thou humble in they pleading,
and the Lord thy God shall bless thee,
Shall bless thee with a sweet and 
calm assurance that he cares.
2. Be thou humble in thy calling,
and the Lord thy God shall teach thee
To serve his children gladly with
a pure and gentle love.
Be though humble in thy longing,
and the Lord thy God shall take thee,
Shall take thee home at last
to ever dwell with him above.
